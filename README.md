# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

During the project:
  
  •	Built and trained a deep neural network
  
  •	Identifies objects appearing in images
  
  •	Using Python, Jupyter notebook and PyTorch
  
  •	Converted the Image classifier into a command line application.
  
  •	Using Pretrained Network e.g VGG16, AlexNet and DenseNet
  
  •	Tested the application's accuracy
  
  • Training the model, validation log and predicting with GPU
